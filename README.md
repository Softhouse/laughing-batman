## What?

This is a REST API server built using ExpressJS and MongoDB.
It has dynamic endpoints, e.g. `POST /item` will create a MongoDB collection called `item` and insert the posted body into the collection. The stored "item" can then be retreived by `GET /item`.

## Get started

Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads).


```bash
git clone <this repo>

cd <repo folder>

npm install

npm start
```

You'll now have a dynamic REST API listening on port `3232` (or the port provided via `PORT` env variable).

## API

**NOTE** `<resource>` and `<relatedResource>` below should be a resource name in singular and dasherized, e.g. "user" or "continuous-integration". `<id>` should be a 24 character long hexadecimal string, i.e. a MongoDB ObjectID string.

### `POST /_hook/<endpoint>`

Can and should be used as a GitHub push webhook to automatically add a repo to the build queue used by [flaming-computing-machine](https://github.com/Softhouse/flaming-computing-machine).

**NOTE** Your repo *must* have a `Dockerfile` in its root folder! Also it listens only for `master` branch pushes.

#### Responses

`201` - The repo was added to the build queue

`204` - Push received but ignored (e.g. push to other branch than `master`)

`500` - Something went wrong when querying the database.

### `POST /_indices/<resource>`

Adds indice/s to `<resource>`.

Expects the indices to be added in the body:

    field: 1
    field2: -1 

1 means asc and -1 desc.

**Be aware that this uses alot of extra memory, use only when you know what you are doing.**
